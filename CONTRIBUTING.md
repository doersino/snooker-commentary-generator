If you have a few lines you'd like to see added, want to make a bug report or just leave a general comment, feel free to

* [file an issue](https://github.com/doersino/snooker-commentary-generator/issues),
* [send a pull request](https://github.com/doersino/snooker-commentary-generator/pulls),
* [comment on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/snooker/comments/53o2hc/snooker_commentary_generator/) or
* [make an anonymous suggestion](https://goo.gl/forms/59Pxv3IBfhcLEhX92).

Please note that any lines you submit should ideally be taken from an actual match, but anything that could reasonably be said by one of the well-known commentators is fine too. Sources are not required at all, but welcome nonetheless.
